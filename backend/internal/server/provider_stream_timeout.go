// delivering data — a long reasoning or coding response would stop mid-answer
// with no [DONE]. A streaming call therefore runs with no total deadline and is
// bounded instead by how long it has been silent: a timer that restarts on every
// delivered byte tells a slow model apart from a dead connection, which a total
